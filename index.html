    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>Who are you looking for?</h3>
        <p>Interested software developers, electronic engineers, designers (UI, UX), researchers, psychologists and
          those with experience with the themes. We're only accepting applications from folks who live and have a right
          to work in the UK, and are over 18 years of age.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>What if I don't know about the themes?</h3>
        <p>Having knowledge is a bonus, but it isn't required. We'll work to provide you with useful context and background knowledge before the event. Once you're there, you'll get to have meaningful chats with delegates and industry mentors to skill up ahead of building your projects.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Who owns my project?</h3>
        <p>The organisers of Utility Week Live and edie Live do, as you are being paid for your input. Consider this a paid piece of
          work, where the work is to take part in a hackathon.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>How much will I be paid?</h3>
        <p>A total of £600 per hacker for the duration of the hackathon (you'll be contracted to attend both days and
          take part in a pre-event ideation, be expected to build/present a project, and write some standard docs for your project).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Will I be expected to do more work on my project after the hackathon, given the cash incentive?</h3>
        <p>Just a one-hour call pre-event with other attendees to share any ideas/questions. Post-event you'll be
          expected to write a reasonable README (we'll give you a template) and transfer your GitHub project repository
          to an org that we set up. That's all!</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>What are you expecting to be built?</h3>
        <p>A prototype of an idea. We'd love to see a working technical prototype, but for some projects this may be a
          design mockup.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Is there a max team size?</h3>
        <p>You can work alone or in pairs, so yes you can work in a team, but the maximum size is two. Each person will have to apply to the event - we aren't accepting team applications.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Will you reimburse my travel, accomodation or food?</h3>
        <p>No. We will provide lunch, snacks and drinks throughout the event. We won't be covering travel or
          accomodation for this event.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Am I expected to stay overnight?</h3>
        <p>This is 100% up to you. We'll have airbeds available, but we also appreciate that you may want to leave the
          venue after the first day officially ends at 6pm and sleep elsewhere. You are responsible for sourcing alternative accomodation.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Do you have a Code of Conduct?</h3>
        <p>Ooh yes, and we will enforce it. It's built into our contract which we'll ask you to sign. You can <a href="https://underland.xyz/conduct">read it
            here</a>.</p>
